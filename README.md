To ensure that bloggers stay on their respective schedules, we would like you to allow them to set regular deadlines for submitting their articles. They should also be able to set their how much time before the deadline they need to be reminded to submit their documents. They can also set multiple reminders. However, each reminder would require acknowledgement from the blogger before firing the next reminder if they have not yet submitted. If they miss a deadline, you may give them a friendly reminder that they have missed the deadline for their submission. Late submissions should be recognised as such.

You can safely assume that the audiences will most likely belong to the Commonwealth and thus be universally most comfortable with British English. To that end, we would like you to perform rudimentary spelling corrections and basic grammar checks upon submission. The blogger can simply be informed of a spelling correction and be required to rectify the grammatical errors. Once the grammatical errors are resolved, they can resubmit and the spellings will be corrected. For example, ‘analyze’ would be corrected to ‘analyse’.
